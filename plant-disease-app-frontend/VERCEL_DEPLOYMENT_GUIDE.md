2. **Add to Vercel**
   - Project Settings → Domains
   - Add your domain
   - Follow DNS instructions

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

#### Build Fails?
```bash
# Test build locally first
npm run build

# If it works locally, check Vercel build logs
```

#### Environment Variables Not Working?
- Must start with `REACT_APP_`
- Redeploy after adding variables
- Check spelling and values

#### 404 Errors on Page Refresh?
- `vercel.json` handles this automatically
